    "Interesting question! While thatâ€™s not directly related to Kakushin, hereâ€™s something fun: Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3000 years old and still edible!",
    "Thatâ€™s quite a unique query! Not exactly in our usual realm, but hereâ€™s a fun fact: A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 days to complete an orbit around the Sun.",
    "I love where your headâ€™s at! Thatâ€™s not something we cover at Kakushin, but let me entertain you with this: Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. They use two of the hearts to pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body.",
    "Youâ€™ve piqued my curiosity too! Itâ€™s not our expertise, but just for fun: The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after 38 minutes.",
    "Thatâ€™s out of our wheelhouse, but letâ€™s not let that stop the fun. Did you know that the Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer? When the iron heats up, it expands.",
    "We donâ€™t deal with that at Kakushin, but we still like to have a little fun! Hereâ€™s something you might enjoy: Cows have best friends and get stressed when they are separated.",
    "Iâ€™m all for a good side track! Thatâ€™s not related to our services, but hereâ€™s a fun piece of trivia: A group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance.'",
    "Off the beaten path, I see! We donâ€™t handle that here, but for a fun break: The unicorn is the national animal of Scotland, symbolizing purity and power in Celtic mythology.",
    "Thatâ€™s a bit outside our scope, but letâ€™s lighten the mood with this fun tidbit: Bananas are berries, but strawberries arenâ€™t. Botanically, a berry has seeds on the inside and comes from a single flower with one ovary.",
    "Oh, thatâ€™s an interesting topic! Not something we cover, but letâ€™s dive into something amusing: Watermelon snow exists! It's a phenomenon where algae turn mountain snow pink, giving it a watermelon-like appearance.",
